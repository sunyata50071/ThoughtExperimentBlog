						<h2>Does AI truly understand what it is doing?</h2>
						<h3>Imagine a person who only speaks English is locked in a room with Egyptian hieroglyphs. Boxes of English instructions are passed into the room for matching hieroglyphs with hieroglyphs. The instructions say, for example, "take this symbol pictured and put it next to this other symbol". As instructions come in, the person in the box places hieroglyphic answers through an outside window. Those outside the box think the person inside is fluent in hieroglyphs but in actual fact they only know English and follow instructions without knowing Egyptian hieroglyphs at all. Is AI any different? </h3>

						<h2>Ibn Sina's floating man</h2>
					<h3>Imagine a person were created fully formed but floating in the air. They cannot see anything and cannot feel their body. They cannot even feel the air. Would this person affirm the existence of themselves? Would the floating man think he exists when he doesn't experience through his five senses?  </h3>

Imagine that the old parts that were replaced are kept and used to build a ship. Eventually, after the original ship has all of its parts replaced, there's two ships. Which is the ship of Theseus?  </h3>
