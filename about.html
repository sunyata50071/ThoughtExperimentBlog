				<p>This site was created in 2025 for the purpose of introducing some popular philosophical thought experiments. After considering the strength of the various arguments presented here, you could consider the nature of thought experiments as a method for inquiry. Do thought experiments bring us closer to really understanding the nature of the world?</p>

						<h2>Does AI truly understand what it is doing?</h2>
						<h3>Imagine a person who only speaks English is locked in a room with Egyptian hieroglyphs. Boxes of English instructions are passed into the room for matching hieroglyphs with hieroglyphs. The instructions say, for example, "take this symbol pictured and put it next to this other symbol". As instructions come in, the person in the box places hieroglyphic answers through an outside window. Those outside the box think the person inside is fluent in hieroglyphs but in actual fact they only know English and follow instructions without knowing Egyptian hieroglyphs at all. Is AI any different? </h3>

She has mastered the scientific explanation of colour but has never experienced it. One day she stumbles upon a red door. Upon experiencing colour for the first time does she aquire new knowledge?</h3>
