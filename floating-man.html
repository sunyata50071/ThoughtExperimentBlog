				<h2>Ibn Sina's floating man</h2>
			    <h3>Imagine a person were created fully formed but floating in the air. They cannot see anything and cannot feel their body. They cannot even feel the air. Would this person affirm the existence of themselves? Would the floating man think he exists when he doesn't experience through his five senses? </h3>

            <p>In "On the Soul" Ibn Sina writes the following passage to argue for the existence of the soul
                "[A] We have now come to know the meaning of the name that applies to
                the thing called ‘soul’ through a relationship that it has. So it would be
                appropriate for us to occupy ourselves with grasping the essence
                (mahiyya) of this thing which is said to be ‘soul’ by the consideration
                [ just discussed].
                [B] We ought to indicate here an affirmation of the existence of soul
                which is an affirmation for us by way of admonition and calling to
                mind (ʿala sabıl al-tanbıh wa-l-tadhkır), as an indication that will
                make a powerful impression on someone who has the capacity for
                noticing the truth by himself, without needing to be instructed,
                prodded, or turned away from sophistries.
                [C] We say: one of us must suppose that he is created all at once, and
                created as perfect, but with his sight prevented from seeing anything
                external [to him]. He is created hovering in the air, or in a void, in such
                a way that the air does not buffet him so that he would have to feel it.
                His limbs are separated so that they do not meet or contact one another.
                [D] Then, he considers whether he affirms the existence of his essence
                (dhat). He has no doubt in his affirmation that his essence is existent,
                even while he does not affirm any extremity among his limbs, nor
                anything inward among his innards—not his heart or his brain—nor
                anything external. Rather, he has affirmed his essence while not
                affirming for it any length, width, or depth. If in this situation he were
                able to imagine a hand or another limb, he would not imagine it as a
                part of his essence, nor as a condition for his essence.
                [E] You know that what is affirmed is distinct from what is not affirmed,
                and what is acknowledged is distinct from what is not acknowledged.
                Therefore, as to the essence whose existence he affirms, it is specific
                (khassiyya) for it that it is identical to him (anna-hahuwa bi-ʿaynihi)
                and distinct from his body or his limbs, which he has not affirmed.
                [F] Thus the alert person has a way to be admonished concerning the
                existence of the soul as something distinct from the body, or rather
                distinct from body (ghayr al-jism bal ghayr jism), and [a way] by
                which he may understand it and be aware of it. But if he is heedless,
                he may need to be prodded."</p>

						<h2>Does AI truly understand what it is doing?</h2>
						<h3>Imagine a person who only speaks English is locked in a room with Egyptian hieroglyphs. Boxes of English instructions are passed into the room for matching hieroglyphs with hieroglyphs. The instructions say, for example, "take this symbol pictured and put it next to this other symbol". As instructions come in, the person in the box places hieroglyphic answers through an outside window. Those outside the box think the person inside is fluent in hieroglyphs but in actual fact they only know English and follow instructions without knowing Egyptian hieroglyphs at all. Is AI any different? </h3>
